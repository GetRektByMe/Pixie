# Setup

But, now we're through all the boring stuff - here's what you need to get it running. This should be in the same folder as setup_example.json although it should be called setup.json
```
{
    "discord":{
        "owner_id": "",
        "command_prefix": "",
        "token": "",
        "pixie_admins": []
    },

    "weeb":{
        "ani_list": "",
        "hummingbird": "",
        "MAL": {
